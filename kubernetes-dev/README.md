developer working in modern software should have mastery over. Dan will teach you what 
Kubernetes is and how to use it in this massive course, from the basics to some of its most 
advanced features. This course is tailored towards software engineers or developers with 
existing knowledge of some programming language but no idea what Kubernetes is or how it works.
