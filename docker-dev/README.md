The skill every developer needs to have
Docker is one of the, if not the most essential, tools that every developer needs to know. 
You need to know what it is, why it is necessary and how you can use everything it offers. 
It has been the most used developer platform tool for the past three years, according to the 
StackOverflow survey and knowing how to use it is required for most developer job listings. 
In this course, author Dan Clarke will teach you everything you need to know to get started 
and master the usage of Docker, from how to install it to how you can publish your very own 
images and use it in your developer workflow.
