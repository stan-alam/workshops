## Logging in .NET

```ascii
Master the feature every single .NET application needs
If there is one topic that every single .NET developer needs to be proficient at, it’s Logging. 
Logging is fundamental to every application that wants to run reliably in production. From APIs, and web apps, 
to Desktop apps and mobile apps or even games, logging should be in place to ensure you have the right information 
you need to know what is going on in your system. Logging will be crucial when something inevitably goes wrong and 
ou need to troubleshoot it. In modern .NET, we are blessed with an excellent built-in logger, but it is also essential 
to be proficient in Serilog, the most popular logging library. In this course, Nick will translate years of valuable 
logging knowledge gained in the field, working on real projects so you can follow the path of success.
