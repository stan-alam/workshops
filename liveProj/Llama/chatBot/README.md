## Live Project building LLM on local machine

Project outline
This liveProject is divided into 6 milestones.

1. Get the Llama Models
Estimated duration: 1 hour

2. Convert to the GGUF Format
Estimated duration: 1-2 hours

3. Inference on the Command Line
Estimated duration: 1-2 hours

4. Use the Chat Template to Carry on a Conversation
Estimated duration: 1 hour

5. Create a Web Service API
Estimated duration: 1-2 hours

6. Create a Chatbot
Estimated duration: 1 hour

The deliverables for this project are a locally deployed Llama model running on low-cost computers or servers and a web-based chatbot that allows users to interact with the model over the Internet.
